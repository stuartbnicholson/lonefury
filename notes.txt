Play.Date
    - Hmm apparently sprite:setRotation is expensive on the hardware!
    - Pre-rotated sprites are suggested, which Asperite handles.
    - Means I could used fixed rotates which might make things easier...
        - 15 degree increments is what the original Bosconian used, although oddly not for the player ship?
            - 7 tiles which can be reflected in X/Y
            - See playdate.graphics.imagetable
    - Also apparently radians are preferred to degrees for video games...
